Following his tour in Iraq, Aaron returned to Virginia where he began his work on Capitol Hill, specializing in the issues of energy, environment, defense, veteran‚Äôs affairs and education. Forging bipartisan coalitions in a politically divided congress, Aaron effectively worked with both Democrats and Republicans to advance numerous pieces of legislation.

He eventually hired me to work for him at the House Committee on Small Business. As I‚Äôm sure some of your staff can attest, the newest staffer often gets the issue no one else wants, and so I started working on Federal procurement policy. Working on contracting, I realized I could make a difference by saving money for taxpayers, improving competition, and helping agencies deliver on their unique missions. More than twenty years later, I still find it compelling. I attended law school at the University of Virginia, earning my J.D., and returned to Washington to practice government contracts law. In 2004, I was honored to join the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) as a senior advisor for government contracts and business development and the Acting Administrator for Government Contracting. In that role, I directed a team of over 140 staff nationwide to help the agency better provide assistance to small businesses seeking Federal procurement opportunities. Our team was able to successfully reduce the cycle time for some small business certifications by 65 percent. I am proud to say that during my tenure, the SBA - for the first time in history - met its statutorily-mandated goal of awarding 23 percent of prime contracts to small businesses. In 2005, I had the privilege of joining GSA and serving as its inaugural Chief Acquisition Officer. In this role, I participated in leading the transformation of the agency‚Äôs assisted acquisition centers, as well as the consolidation of the Federal Supply Service and the Federal Technology Service. As the agency‚Äôs representative to the Federal Acquisition Regulatory (FAR) Council and the leader of the Civilian Agency Acquisition Council, I coordinated efforts to modernize the FAR and GSA regulations to more closely reflect the Federal Government‚Äôs increasing use of service contracts, as opposed to commodity buys. Most importantly, I worked closely with the Inspector General (IG) to address contracting issues in GSA‚Äôs eleven regions, where the IG had identified problems with improper sole source contracts, misuse of small business contracts, out-of-scope orders being placed against contracts, and Anti-Deficiency Act violations. The auditors attributed their findings to an ineffective system of internal management controls and contract personnel prioritizing customer preference over proper procurement procedures. To address these issues, I worked with the GSA Commissioners and the Regional Administrators to: 1) communicate that failure to follow the law would not be tolerated; 2) identify areas where contracting specialists perceived ambiguity and provide clarity regarding expectations and policy; 3) engage in workforce training targeting identified failures or weaknesses; 4) implement an ongoing series of procurement management reviews to identify other outstanding issues; 5) realign reporting chains and performance plans to ensure that contract specialists were evaluated on the quality of their work; 6) communicate with contractors regarding the proper procedures to follow should a task order appear to exceed to scope of the contract; 7) develop the Schedules eLibrary to assist contracting officers in making scope determinations; 8) institute regular meetings with the Department of Defense (DoD) to insure that any DoD specific requirements or funding issues were appropriately addressed by GSA; and 9) engage in ongoing dialogue with the IG so that all issues could be addressed promptly, thus mitigating risk to the taxpayer. GSA continues to have regular program management reviews, engage in targeted training, and maintain many of these processes. After my time at GSA, I rejoined the private sector and gained critical experience and insight on the Federal contracting process from different perspectives ‚Äì as a customer, prime contractor and subcontractor; from the civilian and defense sides; and as a lawyer representing clients seeking to navigate the Federal procurement system. These firsthand experiences have been invaluable, as they provided a holistic view of the Federal contracting process. I know the frustrations of customers seeking to contract with the Federal Government because I have been in their shoes, and if confirmed, I will continue to use that experience to improve the process. In 2011, I returned to the House Committee on Small Business, serving again under a Missouri Chairman, Congressman Sam Graves, and then Chairman Steve Chabot of Ohio. While I specialized in acquisition policy, I also worked on capital access, regulatory reform, tax, and trade issues. The Committee conducted rigorous oversight of contracting agencies, including GSA, and worked on bipartisan legislation that aimed to help small businesses seeking to compete for contracts with the Federal Government. These bipartisan reforms - many of which originated in a Republican House, but were adopted by a Democratic Senate and signed into law by then-President Obama - sought to improve opportunities for service-disabled veterans and small technology firms; minimize barriers to entry; reduce regulatory burdens on prime and subcontractors; reduce waste, fraud, and abuse in government contracting; and streamline design-build contracting. I gained further valuable experience during my time on the House Committee on Armed Services (HASC), working on acquisition issues specific to the DoD, such as challenges with commercial item contracts, auditing, service contracting, program management, acquisition workforce, and business processes at the DoD. Earlier this year, I rejoined GSA, where I analyze topics related to acquisition to provide advice to the Acting Administrator, Tim Horne. For instance, I worked with Acting Administrator Horne on the merger of the Federal Acquisition Service and the Technology Transformation Service, the implementation of the Transactional Data rule, and opportunities to improve how GSA facilitates purchases of technology.','General Services Administration','https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/newsroom/congressional-testimony/nomination-of-emily-w-murphy-to-be-administrator-us-general-services-administration',NULL,'Murphy',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Governor Perdue immediately went to work reforming the state budget, setting priorities, and cutting wasteful spending. His efforts helped stimulate the economy and turn the state budget deficit that he inherited in to a substantial surplus. The Governor then invested in his top priorities and got results. During Perdue‚Äôs first term, Georgia created over 200,000 new jobs and posted the highest graduation rate and SAT scores in state history. After a first term marked by numerous accomplishments, Governor Perdue won re-election by an overwhelming margin in November 2006. As Georgia‚Äôs Governor, Perdue has led the state based on his life experiences prior to entering public service. Sonny was born on December 20, 1946, in Perry, Georgia, to a lifelong farmer and a classroom teacher. He graduated from Warner Robins High School and earned a doctorate in veterinary medicine in 1971 from the University of Georgia. Following his service as a Captain in the United States Air Force, Perdue became a successful small business owner, concentrating in agribusiness and transportation. Today, those businesses have grown to include several locations across the Southeast. Perdue was a respected leader in his church and his community when he decided to enter public service. After serving on the Houston County Planning and Zoning Board during the 1980‚Äôs, he ran for the Georgia State Senate in 1990 and won. Sonny spent the next 11 years representing his Middle Georgia district in the General Assembly. Perdue left the State Senate in 2001 to begin his successful campaign for Governor, which focused on restoring public trust in state government and empowering all Georgians. As a state senator, he was often praised for tackling issues when no one else had the courage to do so and for his ability to grasp the nuances of complex problems. Sonny was recognized as a leading authority on numerous issues including agriculture, transportation, education, emerging technologies and economic development. Perdue campaigned for Governor on a platform of restoring public trust in state government and empowering all Georgians by eliminating undue interference by government bureaucracies. He has dedicated his administration to attracting new businesses and jobs to Georgia, improving the quality of programs that touch the lives of children, and fighting for a comprehensive ethics reform package. For all of his success in business and public service, Governor Perdue is proudest to serve as devoted husband, loving father, and grandfather. Sonny is married to the former Mary Ruff of Atlanta, Georgia. The couple has four children and eleven grandchildren. Additionally, Sonny and Mary have served as foster parents for eight newborns awaiting adoption. The Perdue‚Äôs attend the First Baptist Church of Woodstock, where they have taught a Sunday school class for young couples emphasizing the importance of faith in building a strong and lasting marriage.','Georgia Office of the Governor via Internet Archive','https://web.archive.org/web/20180117193029/http://sonnyperdue.georgia.gov/00/channel_modifieddate/0%252C2096%252C78006749_98067483%252C00.html',NULL,'Perdue',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Wilson was born on December 30, 1960, in Keene, New Hampshire. During her junior year in Keene High School, the U.S. Air Force Academy began admitting women. Wilson, who hoped to become a pilot, like her father and grandfather, entered the academy and graduated in 1982. She earned a Rhodes Scholarship to study at Oxford University where, by 1985, she earned a master‚Äôs and a doctorate in international relations. Wilson served in the Air Force until 1989 when she joined the National Security Council staff as director for European Defense Policy and Arms Control. In 1991, she married lawyer Jay Hone, and the couple settled in New Mexico. They raised three children: Scott, Joshua, and Caitlin. Wilson then started a consulting firm and, from 1995 to 1998, served in the governor‚Äôs cabinet as secretary of the New Mexico children, youth and families department. When New Mexico‚Äôs Albuquerque Congressman Steven H. Schiff declared he would not run for re‚Äìelection in the fall of 1998 because of his battle with skin cancer, Wilson resigned her cabinet post and entered the Republican primary. She won the support of Schiff and U.S. Senator Pete V. Domenici, who lent her several trusted aides and called her ‚Äúthe most brilliantly qualified House candidate anywhere in the country.‚Äù2 But Schiff‚Äôs death in March necessitated a June 23 special election. With Domenici‚Äôs support, Wilson became the Republican candidate for the special election, propelling her to a sizable win in the June 2 primary for the fall election against conservative state senator William F. Davis. Three weeks later, Wilson won the special election (with 45 percent of the vote) in a three‚Äìway race against millionaire Democratic state senator Phillip J. Maloof and Green Party candidate Robert L. Anderson. She was sworn into office on June 25, 1998, making her the first woman since Georgia Lusk in 1946, and the first Republican woman ever, to represent New Mexico.3 The special election was but a preview for the fall election for the full two‚Äìyear term. In both races, Wilson‚Äôs slogan ‚Äúfighting for our families‚Äù encompassed an agenda including better public schools, elimination of the marriage penalty, and an elimination of estate taxes. Both races were contentious and costly. For the June 23 special election Maloof spent $3.1 million and portrayed Wilson as an outsider. Leading up to the November 1998 general election, Maloof spent an additional $5 million to Wilson‚Äôs $1.1 million, making it the most expensive House race in New Mexico‚Äôs history. Wilson prevailed, with 48 percent of the vote. She won her 2000 re‚Äìelection bid by a seven‚Äìpoint margin over her Democratic challenger. In 2002, she defeated Democrat Richard Romero with 55 percent to 45 percent of the vote. Two years later, she defeated Romero by a similar margin to earn a seat in the 109th Congress (2005‚Äì2007). In 2006, when Republicans lost the majority in the House, Wilson faced her stiffest electoral challenge, defeating Democratic candidate Patricia Madrid by 861 votes out of more than 211,000 cast.4 When Wilson took her seat in the House in 1998, she received assignments on the Commerce Committee (later renamed Energy and Commerce), including its subcommittees on Telecommunication, Energy and Air Quality, and Environment and Hazardous Materials. She remained on that panel for the duration of her House career. Wilson also won an additional seat on the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. But she left that assignment in the 107th Congress (2001‚Äì2003) for a seat on the powerful Armed Services Committee. Armed Services offered her a prime vantage point from which to oversee personnel and infrastructure issues at two installations in her district: Kirtland Air Force Base and the Sandia National Lab. In the 109th Congress, Wilson left Armed Services to return to the Intelligence Committee, where she chaired the Subcommittee on Technical and Tactical Intelligence. Wilson‚Äôs reputation in Congress was that of a moderate Republican who was not reluctant to take positions independent of her party. She called for a simplification of the tax codes and became one of the GOP‚Äôs point persons in the House to criticize the American bombing campaign in Kosovo. But on social issues, she was more moderate than many of her GOP colleagues. She supported requiring federal workers‚Äô health plans to cover contraceptive coverage (although she opposed using public money to pay for abortions) and also voted down an amendment that would have banned adoptions by gay parents in the District of Columbia. She also opposed a plan by the Republican leadership to move management of the nuclear weapons program (largely based in New Mexico) from the Department of Energy to the Pentagon.5 In 2006, Wilson led efforts to ensure congressional oversight of the President‚Äôs terrorist surveillance program. Wilson chose not to seek re‚Äìelection to a sixth term in the House, and instead announced her intention to run in 2008 for an open U.S. Senate seat being vacated by longtime New Mexico Senator Pete Domenici. Wilson narrowly lost the Republican primary and retired from the House at the conclusion of the 110th Congress on January 3, 2009.','U.S. House of Representatives','http://history.house.gov/People/Detail/24163',NULL,'Wilson',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

I have enjoyed working for a wide range of clients, from restaurants to medical clinics, and from authors and musicians to independent filmmakers and record labels, as well as employees, students, and citizens whose civil rights may have been violated. I also appreciate staying connected to my alma maters, Stanford University and Pepperdine University School of Law.

She was able to successfully juggle life in D.C., frequent trips to Wisconsin, and a pile of coursework in order to complete the requirements for graduation this summer.

More than anything, Vanessa understands the power of internships. ‚ÄúInternships are very beneficial to a career on the Hill,‚Äù she writes. ‚ÄúAs an intern you have the opportunity to build relationships with staff and members of Congress, as well as get a taste for the expectations of working on the Hill. From my experiences, you can never go wrong with a positive attitude. The environment on the Hill can become very intense at times, and a positive mindset and determination to work hard can go a long way.‚Äù

Maintaining solid work relationships is critical in a job like Vanessa‚Äôs. ‚ÄúMy daily duties include assisting office Senior Staff, creating daily schedules for the Staff Assistants and Interns, and helping with the operations side of outside groups visiting the office (located inside the Capitol building). I enjoy all aspects of my job, which I think is a symptom of working with and for really great people,‚Äù she says.

Political Science was an obvious choice for Vanessa, and she uses the skills she earned here every day. ‚ÄúI chose Political Science as a major because of my passion for politics and interest in the minutiae of studying law. Many of my skills obtained through my Political Science degree have extended into my current job,‚Äù she writes. And she echoes something we hear from employers a lot: critical thinking and research are not just classroom projects, but essential job skills. ‚ÄúFirst and foremost, I would say that the skill of being able to think critically has been the most significant as many of my daily duties involve quick decision-making,‚Äù Vanessa writes. ‚ÄúThe ability to know how to conduct research has also proven itself to be invaluable, which was a skill emphasized during my time in the Political Science department at UW-Oshkosh.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy mom was my first mentor and role model,‚Äù Laurie said. ‚ÄúI watched her commitment to her profession and observed her passion for meeting the individual needs of students.‚Äù

During the four years she spent earning her Bachelor of Science degree at Grand Valley State University in Grand Rapids, MI, Laurie‚Äôs passion for meeting the needs of students with disabilities grew. After she graduated in 1976, she kicked off her career by working with high school students as a special education teacher at Wayland Union Schools.

Laurie‚Äôs experience in the field of special education expands far beyond the classroom. After teaching high schoolers and middle schoolers for 15 years, Laurie returned to Grand Valley to earn her master‚Äôs degree in special education administration, which has proven valuable in her work. She has since served as supervisor of special education for Grand Rapids Public School District, special education consultant with the Michigan Department of Corrections, and most recently as director of special education for Kent Intermediate School District. She also plays a vital role in helping special education administrators develop strong leadership competencies by teaching classes in Grand Valley‚Äôs Special Education Administration Program.','Department of Education','https://sites.ed.gov/osers/2018/10/announcing-new-osep-director/',NULL,'Vanderploeg',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
